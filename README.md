# Big data project

## The purpose of this project
The goal of this project is to display two graphs. First a line graph depicting the total amount of vehicular accidents in France from 2010 to 2020, based on vehicle type, and seriousness of the accident (whether it's a light accident, or a fatal one).
The second graph will be a point cloud with the years on the x-axis, and the age of the vehicle on the y axis. Each point will represent 1000 accidents, and each point will have a different color based on the type of vehicle.
