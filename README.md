# Big data project

## The purpose of this project
The goal of this project is to display a live graph of all the current passengers of a given metro line in Paris.
However, if the API we are working with isn't capable of providing us with such information, then we will fallback and resort to simply plotting out the most frequented metro stations per line in Paris.
This project will be carried out in Python, using pandas.

## Resources
The data used in this project has been gathered from the RATP's [data website](https://data.ratp.fr/explore/dataset/trafic-annuel-entrant-par-station-du-reseau-ferre-2020/information/).
The RATP also provides us with a [real time API](https://data.ratp.fr/page/temps-reel/).
